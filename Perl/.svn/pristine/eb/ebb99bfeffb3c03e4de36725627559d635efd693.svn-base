This directory contains a few example CQi client scripts written in Perl,
based on the CWB::CQI reference implementation.


1) Tkwic.perl

Tkwic is a simple Perl/Tk GUI front-end for CQP.  In order to run this example,
the complete Perl/Tk distribution has to be installed in addition to the CWB::CQI
package.  If a CQPserver is available on the local machine, you can start up Tkwic
simply by typing

  perl Twkic.perl

Tkwic will then use the CWB::CQI::Server module to launch a private CQPserver process.

Otherwise, specify the connection details for a remote CQi server as follows:

  perl Tkwic.perl <user> <password> [<host> [<port>]]

If <port> is omitted, the default CQi port is assumed; if <host> is omitted, Tkwic
attempts to connect to "localhost".


2) MicroCQP.perl

MicroCQP is a very minimalistic command-line front-end that executes CQP queries
through the CQi client-server interface.  MicroCQP can either launch a private
CQPserver process on the local machine (if available) with

  perl MicroCQP.perl

or connect to a remote CQi server if the connection details are specified on the
command line:

  perl MicroCQP.perl <user> <password> [<host> [<port>]]

As with Tkwic, <host> and <port> default to "localhost" and the standard CQi port.

When MicroCQP has started up, type "show" to display a list of corpora.  Then enter
the name of a corpus in uppercase in order to activate this corpus.  You can now
enter CQP commands, which will be executed on the CQi server.  MicroCQP automatically
displays ALL matches with sentence context, so you may want to restrict your queries
by appending a suitable "cut" clause.
