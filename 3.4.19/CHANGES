Version 3.4 (in progress)
-----------

New features:

 - cwb-scan-corpus now accepts negated regular expression constraints (e.g. 'lemma+0!=/anti.*/c').
   The -C option is consistently ignored for constraint keys ('?...'), and documented to be.
   It is also now compatible with multiple ISO-8859 character sets and with UTF-8.

 - cwb-lexdecode now has a "no-blanks" option (-b) to turn off the padding of numeric columns with
   spaces to the minimum width of seven.

 - cwb-encode can now apply cleanup (-C) to UTF-8 data.

 - cwb-encode now accepts XML "empty" tags <likeThis/> , but treats them as opening tags.

 - cwb-align is now safe for use with UTF-8 corpora.

 - There is now a precise limit on the size of a CWB corpus: CL_MAX_CORPUS_SIZE = 2^32 - 1 tokens;
   cwb-encode will discard additional input data with a warning once the limit has been reached

 - CQP can now cope with concordance left/right context of indefinite size.

 - Implementation of n-gram hashes has been moved from cwb-scan-corpus to the CL library, so it
   can be used by other applications.  In the process, the implementation has been revised for 
   slightly improved efficiency and memory footprint.
   
 - cwb-scan-corpus is now faster and uses less memory, especially if used without fine-tuning
   the number of hash buckets (-b option).  For example, scanning a 200 M word corpus for word
   bigrams (with -C filtering) requires 30% less memory and is four times faster than before.

 - CQP's "group" command has been reimplemented using a hash-based algorithm, making it much
   more efficient for large frequency counts.  For example, a grouping over approx. 400,000
   distinct values is now 150x faster than before.  This change also resolves poor performance
   of CQPweb when executing queries with hits in a very large number of texts (100,000 or more),
   which is quite common e.g. for Web corpora.
 
 - The "group" command supports properly grouped frequency counts, as the name has always
   implied.  Use e.g. "group A match lemma by target lemma;" to sort pairs by co-occurrence
   frequency, and "group A match lemma group by target lemma;" to group items by target.
   
 - KWIC displays with character contexts now work correctly for UTF-8 encoded corpora.
 
 - Full support for PCRE regular expressions, including case (%c) and accent (%d) folding.
   Case-folding now uses PCRE's caseless mode rather than case-folding input strings.
   If PCRE is compiled with JIT capability, this is much faster than the previous approach
   (and than using the regexp optimizer, which still needs case-folding). The optimizer
   now parses regexps more defensively and recognizes a larger subset of PCRE syntax, which
   should cover most wildcard-like searches carried out by users.

 - [2017-03-02: v3.4.11] CWB-wide support for reading and writing compressed files with suffix ".gz" or ".bz2",
   provided by automagic cl_open_stream() and cl_close_stream() functions. (De)compression still relies on
   external gzip or bzip2 utility, which must be in standard search path.  The CL automagic also supports shell
   pipes ("| cmd" for both read and write pipes), recognizes "-" for stdin/stdout, expands "~" to the user's
   home directory.

 - cwb-scan-corpus can now optionally sort its output in canonical lexicographic ordering, making
   it easier to merge multiple frequency counts (from different corpora)
   
 - [2017-03-16: v3.4.11] New built-in function normalize(string, "%cd") in CQP queries, which applies
   case- and/or diacritic-folding. The recommended use case is a case-folded (etc.) comparison of two
   attribute values. Note that any condition involving built-in functions cannot make use of index lookup.
   
 - [2017-07-01: v3.4.12] An embedded modifier such as "(?longest)" can be used at the start of a CQP query 
   to change the matching strategy temporarily. This is particularly useful for Web interfaces like CQPweb
   which do not allow users explicit control over the MatchingStrategy option. 

 - [2018-01-13: v3.4.13] New built-in functions lbound_of(attr, pos) and rbound_of(attr, pos) that return the
   start/end corpus position of an s-attribute region containing pos (usually _  or a label reference).
   The second argument is necessitated by technical restrictions on built-in functions.
 
 - [2018-04-25: v3.4.14] CWB no longer breaks on input files with Windows-style (CRLF) line endings. In
   particular, cwb-encode, cwb-s-encode, CQP word lists, macro definition files and CQP scripts handle
   CRLF files correctly and delete the extra CR characters.
   
 - [2018-06-26: v3.4.15] New "subcorpus" output mode for cwb-decode, which can be used to materialize a
   physical subcorpus based on a CQP query dump. The CWB/Perl package includes a convenient command-line
   tool "cwb-make-subcorpus" for this purpose.

 - [2019-05-07: v3.4.16] Experimental feature allowing multiple target markers @0 .. @9. Only two of these
   markers are "active" at the same time, as determined by the AnchorNumberTarget and AnchorNumberKeyword
   options; they set the target (equivalent to @) and keyword anchors, respectively.
   This allows front-end wrappers to emulate up to 10 target positions by re-running a query with different
   settings of AnchorNumberTarget and AnchorNumberKeyword; see "Undocumented CQP" in the CQP tutorial for details.

Bug fixes:

 - [2011-11-03: v3.4.1] CQP no longer crashes with a segmentation fault when trying to display very long kwic lines
   with "cat" (bug #1549254); instead, lines are silently truncated. The standard buffer size has also been increased
   to 64k bytes, which is sufficient to display the longest BNC sentences in BNCweb (with many attributes shown).

 - [2012-01-14: v3.4.2] Huffmann compression now works even for very large corpora of around 2 billion words
   (bug #2929062). The Huffmann algorithm in cwb-huffcode has been modified to ensure no code words with more
   than 31 bits are generated (which would occasionally happen for hapax legomena in a 2 billion word corpus).
   Even though the actual Huffman codes are now different, the index file format is not affected and should be
   fully compatible between older and newer CWB versions.

 - [2012-02-02: v3.4.3] Made cwb-scan-corpus "regular words" mode fully UTF-8 compatible.

 - [2012-05-01] Updated regexp optimiser to work correctly with the extended set of wildcards, escape sequences,
   and special groups in PCRE regular expressions. CURRENTLY IN TESTING PHASE.

 - [2012-05-20: v3.4.4] Fixed bug causing segmentation fault in cwb-scan-corpus.

 - [2012-07-17: v3.4.5] Fixed bug causing segmentation fault in CQP when cat output with header is requested.
 
 - [2013-05-08: v3.4.7] Fixed problems with command-line completion on Mac OS X (bugs #8 and #55); #8 was a 
   buffer overflow for long lists of completion candidates; #55 is fixed by auto-detecting a genuine GNU Readline
   library installed by the user in /usr/local or with a package manager such as HomeBrew.
   
 - [2013-05-09] Fixed bug #45: implicit expansion of named query result (e.g. with A^s) is recomputed on every
   access, so it updates automatically if the underlying query A is changed. This produces noticeable overhead
   only for query results containing more than 10 million matches, and usage of implict expansion is deprecated.
   Parser now distinguishes between plain IDs and named query specifiers (e.g. BNC:Result^s), so it is no longer
   possible to use A^s as the name of a query result.
 
 - [2014-06-16: v3.4.8] Fixed bug whereby a UTF-8 character could be broken up, creating invalid sequences, by
   CQP's system for character-based context size. (CQP is still "dumb" in that it counts strings in bytes not
   characters in UTF-8, but this is a less critical problem, or should be.)

 - [2016-03-20] Edge case in "tabulate" output, which resulted in incorrect CQPweb collocation analysis under
   certain circumstances, has been fixed.  Precise behaviour for out of bounds values now documented in the
   CQP Query Language Tutorial.

 - [2016-07-19: v3.4.10] Fixed bug in settings for cross-compile to Windows. Removed cwb-atoi.exe and cwb-itoa.exe
   from Windows release builds, as they trigger malware alerts both on SF.net (our distribution platform) and on
   some (but not all) standalone antivirus software. 

 - [2016-07-19: v3.4.10] Fixed CQP bug for fixed-character width concordance. First, it will no longer split
   UTF-8 characters apart at the far left/far right of the concordance. Second, it will count the number of
   co-text characters accurately (previously, you would often get fewer characters than you asked for with
   UTF-8 corpora).
 
 - [2016-07-19: v3.4.10] Fixed serious bugs with case-insensitive PCRE regular expressions, caused by previous
   approach of case-folding the regexp itself (which modifies escape sequences such as \W and \pL). 

 - [2016-07-19] Sort order is no longer locale-dependent for corpora with UTF-8 encoding.
 
 - [2016-07-20] Fixed bug #58: cwb-huffcode used to fail on p-attributes with a single unique type, for which
   the Huffmann algorithm would determine an optimal code length of 0 bits. Simply force code length to 1 bit
   in this special case, which will automatically generate the code '0' for the single type.
 
 - [2016-07-20] Fixed bug #49: SIGPIPE handler is now installed automatically by open_stream() and checked
   by all CQP commands that print substantial amounts of output (cat, dump, sort, count, group, tabulate).

 - Revised makefile configuration so compiler and linker flags for Glib and PCRE can be set explicitly. Most
   users will be happy with the default settings (using pkg-config and pcre-config for auto-detection) and 
   when compiling for Windows with MinGW the new settings are ignored. Default configuration now changed to
   "darwin-brew", which no longer supports universal binaries on Mac OS X.
   
 - [2017-04-27] A little-known (and undocumented) limitation of CWB is that the lexicon of a p-attribute may
   not exceed a total size of 2 GiB because string offsets are stored as 32-bit integers. The same holds for
   the "lexicon" of an s-attribute with annotations, i.e. the set of all distinct annotation strings.
   The cwb-encode and cwb-s-encode utilities now check for integer overflow and abort with an informative
   error message in this case.
 
 - [2017-07-01] Fixed bug #1: with aligned queries, the "cut" clause was applied to the source language, and
   alignment constraints would then further reduce the number of matches. The only solution with the current
   implementation of CQP is to run every aligned query to completion and only then reduce the total number of
   matches to the specified cut value. 

 - [2017-07-02] Fixed bug #41: potential edge-case buffer overflow with cl_string_canonical. We have never had
   a report of this actually happening to anyone, but we will sleep sounder knowing it can't happen.
   
 - [2017-08-19] Fixed bug #64: CQP grammar accepts negative repetition counts in standard and TAB queries. While
   we did not receive any bug reports from users, negative counts and other invalid ranges such as {3,2} would
   result in unexpected behaviour, including segementation faults and memory overflow. Such issues are now
   captured by the query parser and report a syntax error.

 - [2017-11-13] "cut NQR x [y];" now disallows negative indices and behaves as documented even in edge cases.
   It is no longer an error to specify x or y exceeding the number of hits; the indices will be clamped 
   automatically without a warning. A warning is still printed if "cut" results in an empty query result.

 - [2018-01-13: v3.4.13] bare reference to s-attribute incorrectly returned an evaluation error (which is
   interpreted as false in most contexts) if not in a corresponding region, whereas it should have returned the code 0

 - [2019-03-02: v3.4.15] contrary to the CQP Tutorial (Sec. 3.6), the "cut" command did not respect the sort order
   of a NQR, but always selected items based on the original corpus order; fixed to match documentation
   
 - [2019-05-05: v3.4.16] fix handling of parsing errors in CQP queries, which was broken by r1075 (2018-09-26). 
 
 - [2019-08-01: v3.4.18] activating a new corpus in CQP no longer affects the ordering of attributes in "show cd"
   and kwic output ("cat"); they are now guaranteed always to be in the same order as in the registry file;
   "show cd" in non-PrettyPrint mode also indicates whether an attribute is activated for display

Enhancements:

 - [2014-06-18] Revised implementation of cl_lexhash class. Auto-growing is now based on fill rate statistic
   rather than empirical performance measurements, which simplifies the code quite a bit. Auto-grow parameters
   (fill rate limit and target value after expansion) are exposed to applications and have new default settings.
   Optimization: Hash keys are now embedded directly in entries rather than allocated as separate strings,
   which improves speed, memory overhead and cache locality by a small amount.

 - [2014-06-19] New class cl_ngram_hash (based on cl_lexhash) encapsulates part of the functionality of the
   cwb-scan-corpus tool, making it accessible to other applications.  The new class should be slightly more
   efficient and memory-friendly than the original code because it embeds n-grams directly in the hash entries.

 - [2015-06-19: v3.4.9] cwb-scan-corpus now uses cl_ngram_hash for counting, resulting in substantial performance
   improvement (both speed and memory footprint) in certain situations.

 - [2015-06-19: v3.4.9] Hash-based reimplementation of CQP's "group" command is much faster for frequency counts
   over large sets of distinct items (up to 150x speed-up in extreme cases) and supports grouped listing of
   frequencies (as the name of the command has always implied).
 
 - [2017-07-01: v3.4.12] MU queries are now documented in the CQP tutorial and have a consistent "filtering"
   semantics.
 
 - [2017-08-20: v3.4.12] Undocumented and unsupported TAB queries now work again. The matching algorithm has been
   modified slightly and is explained in the CQP tutorial. However, no guarantees are made wrt. performance and
   the precise semantics of TAB queries, except for special cases where all distances are either fixed or "*".

 - [2017-11-14] Reserved words can be used as identifiers (e.g. attribute names) if they are quoted betweeen
   backticks, e.g. size `MU`; [`sort` = "A.*"]; show +`no`;  Keep in mind that quotes aren't necessary in label
   definitions (size: []) or qualified references (size.lemma) and will not be accepted in these contexts.
   
 - [2018-01-13: v3.4.13] If a built-in function is called with an undefined value (internal type ATTAT_NONE) and
   does not explicitly handle such cases, it returns an undefined value (ATTAT_NONE). This change was necessitated by
   today's bug fix for bare s-attribute references: built-in functions such as distabs(_, lbound_of(title, _)) 
   may be called with ATTAT_NONE where the call would previously have been skipped due to the error raised by
   the reference to title outside a <title> region. The new behaviour is consistent with NULL values in SQL.
   Keep in mind that undefined values evaluate to false in a Boolean context.

 - [2018-04-25: v3.4.14] New CQP command (cat "STRING" [> "file.txt"];) can be used to print arbitrary strings
   in CQP output, which is convenient for communicating with output post-processor scripts and for prepending
   a header row to a TAB-delimited output file. Escape sequences \n, \r and \t are interpreted, but no other
   substitutions are made in the string to be printed.
   
 - [2018-09-25: v3.4.15] Extended the CQP "show" command to allow "show active"/"show current" to print the
   name of the presently-active corpus. (In interactive mode, this info is visible in the prompt; but in child
   mode it's nice to have a direct way to ask this.)
   
 - [2018-05-06: v3.4.16] Command-line completion now also works for option names after the "set" keyword at 
   the start of a line. Option abbreviations are deliberately not supported.
   
 - [2019-08-01: v3.4.18] CQP option AttributeSeparator modifies separator between p-attributes in CQP kwic display.

 - [2019-12-07: v3.4.19] String normalisation now uses a different Glib function which produces slightly more
   intuitive results when uppercase strings become lowercase (especially for German).


Version 3.2
-----------

Version 3.2 of CWB adds Unicode support (utf8). It also breaks backwards compatability in one,
possibly important way: all "identifiers" (names of corpora, attributes, subcorpora etc.) must use ASCII characters
only - no Latin1 accented letters, for instance. This is necessary to avoid potential conflicts between Latin1 and
UTF8 encodings in filenames and directory paths. Any corpora you have from earlier versions which use accented 
letters in their "identifiers" must be reindexed to work with version 3.2 or above.

As a result of the work on Unicode, character set awareness is now active throughout CWB. Also, the regular 
expression language supported in the CL and through CQP has changed from POSIX-flavour regexes to PCRE regexes
(Perl-compatible). In UTF8 corpora, all unicode properties, etc., can be used in regular expressions using the
usual PCRE syntax.

Other changes:

 - cwb-encode now validates the encoding of files as it imports them against the corpus character set. Invalid
   bytes or byte sequences lead to an abort. The default character set is Latin1, this can be changed with
   the -c option. For ASCII and ISO8859-* character sets, invalid bytes (such as the [\x80-\x9f] range) can
   automatically be replaced by '?' characters if the -C option is specified.
   
 - the Corpus Library (CL) has been reorganised to make programming against it easier, and it now contains 
   several more utility functions.

 - command-line editing backported from included Editline library to external GNU Readline (which was originally
   used by CQP but had to be replaced for licensing reasons before the CWB was made open-source)


Version 3.1
-----------

Version 3.1 of CWB runs on Windows (currently, by cross-compilation on Linux using MinGW).
This was accomplished by incorporating back into the main code base changes made to a branch of CWB by Serge 
Heiden and colleagues on the Textometrie project. There are no other new features.


Version 3.0
-----------

This was the first official release of the IMS Open Corpus Workbench.
 - released April 2010, after some testing by developer community (and perhaps an overhaul of installation procedure)
 - binary packages for various platforms (but not all) are available as well as the source.

New features:

 - Configuration no longer requires explicit knowledge of CPU endianness, relying instead on system macros
   htonl() and nothl() to convert between platform-independent disk format and native byte ordering.
   This simplifies compilation on generic Unix platforms and allows true Universal releases on Mac OS X.

 - cwb-encode now supports format validation and normalisation for feature set attributes (see CQP tutorial for
   and introduction).  Attributes declared with trailing slash "/" are considered as feature sets.  If a value
   is not well-formed, a warning is issued (for every line containing a malformed feature set!) and the value
   is replaced by the empty set |.  Annotations of s-attributes can also be treated as feature sets, including
   individual element attributes; in this case, the "/" marker has to be attached to the main attribute name
   (e.g. -V flags/:2) or the respective element attribute declaration (e.g. -S np:2+agr/+head+f/).
   
 - New "-F <dir>" option for cwb-encode reads all input files named *.vrt or *.vrt.gz in the specified
   directory (very convenient if a corpus consists of many small individual files).  Only regular files will
   be considered, and it is not possible to scan subdirectories recursively.  If no input files are found
   in a directory, a warning message is printed on stderr, but the encoding process continues.

 - For s-attributes with annotated values, cwb-s-decode can optionally suppress either the annotated
   strings (-v) or the start and end positions of regions (-n).

 - Registry path list (in CORPUS_REGISTRY variable and -r options) may contain optional registry directories
   indicated by a leading '?' character.  If these are not mounted, CQP will not issue warning messages; if
   they are mounted, all tools should ignore the '?' in the pathname.

 - The header line of undump files (for the "undump" command in CQP) is now optional, provided that the
   undump is a regular file (not a pipe or standard input).  CQP will automatically detect the new format
   and read the file in two passes (first pass counts lines, second pass reads actual data).  This modification
   simplifies data exchange with external programs such as spreadsheets, SQL databases and R.

 - Evil hacks in cwb-scan-corpus allow frequency counts for s-attributes with annotations (since 2007),
   and now also special constraints such as "?footnote" for s-attributes without annotations.

 - String quoting in CQP has been revised in order to allow safe quoting of arbitrary strings.  Strings can be
   enclosed in single or double quotes (which are equivalent), and inside the string any character can be
   escaped with a preceding backslash (\).  Backslashes are passed through and interpreted by the regexp engine;
   the sequences \' \" \, \` \^ trigger latex-style escapes for accented Latin1 characters.  For instance,
   '\'em' matches an accented "e" rather than the sequence "'e" (followed by "m").  Strings can be safely quoted
   by doubling any occurrence of the surrounding delimiter, e.g. '''em' to match "'em".  These doubling escapes
   are removed by the lexical scanner, so they work in all string contexts and do not trigger any side effects.

Bug fixes:

 - [2008-01-03] Fixed a strange bug in which the query
        ([pos = "IN|TO"] [pos = "DT.*"]? [pos = "JJ.*"]* [pos = "N.*"]+){3};
   causes CQP to segfault on Darwin/PowerPC platforms (discovered on Mac OS X 10.4 with PowerPC G4 CPU).
   The problem occurs for >= 3 repetitions, but not for 1 or 2 repetitions.  It turned out that 
   AddState()<cqp/regex2dfa.c> reallocates the state table STab[], which might move it to a different
   memory location, breaking a pointer into the array held by calling function FormState() in a local variable SP.
   This bug was difficult to find because it only causes problems if the original memory location of STab[]
   is overwritten immediately (perhaps by shifting STab[] to an overlapping location); otherwise, access through
   the stale copy pointed to by SP works fine.  To fix the bug, SP is now updated in FormState()<cqp/regex2dfa.c>
   immediately after calling AddState().

 - [2008-05-05] Added code to detect infinite loops in FSA simulation when executing a standard CQP query. Such
   loops can be caused by unlimited quantification over zero-width elements (XML tags and lookahead constraints),
   but will be triggered only in certain circumstances. While these queries are obviously nonsensical, novice
   users of Web interfaces often write things like ``<s> * ...'', thinking that ``*'' matches an arbitrary word.
   Some examples should illustrate the problem:
        <s> *         # not executed ("start state is final state")
        <s> +         # runs normally, but returns no matches (because all matches have length zero)
        <s> * []      # works correctly in standard mode, but triggers infinite loop in longest match mode
        <s> * "xxx"   # gets stuck in infinite loop if "xxx" doesn't match
        "!" (<p> <s> | [: word = "[A-Z].*" :]){3,} "The"  # infinite loops aren't always easy to detect
   A simple solution has been implemented which tests the state/position vector after each FSA simulation step.
   If the vector hasn't changed, the FSA must be in an infinite loop and query execution is aborted with an
   emphatic error message (in case the new code should abort a valid query). This catches most cases, but some
   more complex situations (as the last example above) will still get stuck: because of the way the FSA is
   implemented in CQP, it will oscillate between different configurations of active states.  A fully reliable
   solution would require an analysis of "empty" cycles in the FSA before query execution.

 - [2008-08-29] If CQP is run as a backend and the master process is killed, CQP hangs and produces 100% CPU load,
   apparently because it's still trying to read from its input pipe which keeps returning error conditions. As a
   workaround, CQP now exits immediately (with an error message on stderr) if it is running in child mode (-c) and
   and error condition is detected on the input stream.

 - [2009-01-04] Fixed all compiler warnings where possible (for Universal build on Mac OS X with gcc-4.0)

 - [2009-01-05] The "-d" (data directory) option for cwb-encode is now mandatory, so if you just type "cwb-encode",
   it will no longer litter your current working directory with empty data files and wait for standard input.

 - [2009-01-25] Error reporting of CL library has been made more consistent (including some obvious bugs),
   triggered by stricter tests in new version of the Perl API (CWB::CL module).  Also introduced some new
   error codes (e.g. for internal buffer overflow), but these are not checked and set systematically yet.

 - [2009-02-26] Added safety checks to cwb-encode in order to ensure that annotation strings are not longer than
   the internal hard-coded limit of MAX_LINE_LENGTH-1 characters.  Oversized annotation strings are now truncated
   with a warning message.

 - [2009-06-11] Fixed segmentation fault in cwb-align on 64-bit platforms (original developer had assumed that
   a pointer always has the same sized as an unsigned int ... aaaargh!).  Kudos to Bogdan Babych (b.babych@leeds.ac.uk)
   for a beautiful and fully reproducible bug report.

 - [2010-01-09] NOT FIXED: Huffman codes may exceed maximal allowed code length of 31 bits in some extreme cases,
   which was not checked in cwb-huffcode and could lead to buffer overflows and segmentation faults.  The program
   now aborts with an error message, but the underlying problem has not been fixed yet.  It is NOT POSSIBLE just
   to increase MAXCODELEN<cl/attributes.h>, as this changes the index file format and breaks compatibility with
   previously encoded corpora.  The only good solution is to patch the Huffman code generation so that it computes
   a suboptimal code in this cases that stays within the allowed limit, but for this somebody needs to go through
   and understand the entire code in compute_code_lengths()<utils/cwb-huffcode.c>. 

 - [2010-02-09] cwb-encode now checks that data directory and registry directory exist, and that registry filename
   specified with -R doesn't contain uppercase letters, in order to avoid strange errors later on (patch contributed
   by Alberto Simoes).


Version 2.2.b99 (2007-03-11)
----------------------------

 - initial public release of the CWB source code on http://cwb.sf.net
 - source code and build system has already been cleaned up from the IMS-internal version
 - intended to be ready for public release (as v3.0) without major changes or additions
