/**
 * Checks the encoding of a string.
 *
 * This function looks for bad bytes (or byte sequences in the case of UTF8);

 *
 * The string can optionally be "repaired" in-place by replacing bad bytes with
 * '?' characters.  If the "repair" is successful, the function returns True.
 *
 * What counts as "bad" is of course relative to the character set that the
 * string is encoded in - so this must be specified.
 *

 *
 * @param s        Null-terminated string to check.
 * @param charset  CorpusCharset of the string's encoding.
 * @param repair   if True, replace invalid bytes by '?'

/**
 * Converts a string to canonical form.
 *
 * The "canonical form" of a string is for use in comparisons where
 * case-insensitivity and/or diacritic insensitivity is desired.
 *
 * This function has two behaviours: inplace modification, or copy modification.
 *
 * INPLACE MODIFICATION:  the string s is modified in place, up to a maximum size of
 * inplace_bufsize-1 characters (plus NUL terminator). If the normalised string
 * doesn't fit into the buffer, the extra characters are dropped silently.
 * Ergo, for things to definitely work correctly, the buffer should have enough
 * memory to cope with any expansions made in Unicode case folding. Ideally,
 * allocate double the length of the string (since case-folding doesn't include
 * any one -> more-than-two mappings so far as we know). To use the function in this
 * mode, pass in the amount of memory available at s as the last argument.
 * In this mode, the return value is always equal to s.
 *
 * COPY MODIFICATION: the string s is modified; a newly-allocated copy is created
 * and modified; and a pointer to the copy is  returned.
 * It is then the caller's responsibility to free this memory.
 * To use the function in this mode, pass a value less than 1 as the last
 * argument (or the aide memoire constant CL_STRING_CANONICAL_STRDUP).
 *
 * FLAGS: IGNORE_DIAC and/or IGNORE_CASE, for diacritic/case folding resectively.
 * In UTF8, an additional flag REQUIRE_NFC can be passed to normalize the
 * string into the canonical pre-composed form (NFC) used internally by CWB.
 * All strings that are going to be inserted into or searched for within an
 * indexed corpus should be processed in this way.
 *
 * API HISTORY: the arguments of this string were changed in v3.2.1. Now,
 * a CorpusCharset is needed. This is because string canonicalising works
 * differently in UTF8, where case folding / accent folding is done by calling
 * Unicode-aware functions. By contrast, the process for 8-bit charsets just uses a
 * straightforward mapping table for both sorts of folding.
 *
 * The arguments were changed in 3.4.12 to add a fourth argument, inplace_bufsize:
 * this prevents buffer overflow bylimiting the amount of inplace-overwriting
 * that can be done.
 *
 * @see CL_STRING_CANONICAL_STRDUP
 *
 * @param s                The string.
 * @param charset          The character set in which the string is encoded.
 *                         If this is utf8, complex accent and/or case folding will be done,
 *                         as per the Unicode standard.
 *                         If it is anything else, internal byte mapping tables will be used.
 * @param flags            The flags that specify which conversions are required.
 *                         Can be IGNORE_CASE | IGNORE_DIAC | REQUIRE_NFC .
 * @param inplace_bufsize  Size of the buffer. If > 0, string s will be modified in place,
 *                         avoiding buffer overruns. If 0 or less, s will be left as is,
 *                         and a copy created, modified, and returned.
 *                         The constant CL_STRING_CANONICAL_STRDUP is provided to make this
 *                         more readable when calling (it's -1).
 * @return                 The canonical string. If inplace modification was used,
 *                         this will be the same as s. If not, it will be a newly allocated
 *                         string. If there is an error of any kind, the return will be
 *                         inplace/new as expected, but will not contain the requested
 *                         modifications (or will contain only some of them).

 * protect against the opposite danger of losing important data from the end of
 * a truncated string.
 *
 * Note, buffer overflow is still possible if buf is a pointer to the middle
 * of a buffer.
 *
 * So this function is not a panacea, it's just a bit of a help.
 *
 * It's also implemented in a way that is safe for down-strcpying, that is, if
 * we are erasing a section from the start/middle of the string - cl_strcpy(string,
 * string+3); for instance). The POSIX standard states that the normal strcpy
 * has undefined behaviour if the objects overlap. That's not the case here.
 *
 * @param buf  A string buffer to copy to.
 * @param src  The string pointer to copy from.
 * @return     In classic strcpy-stylie, this function uselessly returns buf.
