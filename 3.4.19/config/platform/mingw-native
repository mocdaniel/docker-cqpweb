##
##  TEMPLATE FOR PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILES
##

#
# A) Required settings
#

## C compiler: Gnu C compiler (GCC) is highly recommended
CC = gcc

## C compiler flags (optimisation, warning, additional include directories)
CFLAGS = -O2 -Wall

## Linker flags (libraries to link against, search path, static linkage)
LDFLAGS = -lm

## Parser and lexical scanner generator (recommended combination is bison + flex)
YACC = bison -d -t
LEX = flex -8

## How to combine object files into a library archive (*.a) and build a table of contents
## (ranlib is optional, simply set to "echo" or so to skip
AR = ar cq
RANLIB = ranlib

#
# B) Optional (recommended) settings
#

## Support for command-line editing in CQP (using external GNU Readline)
# READLINE_LIBS = -L <path_to_readline_libs> -lreadline -lhistory
# READLINE_DEFINES = -I <path_to_readline_headers>

## Support for text highlighting in CQP (Termcap or Curses library, ncurses is widely available)
# TERMCAP_LIBS = -lncurses
# TERMCAP_DEFINES = 

## Include debugging information in binaries (depends on C compiler, only recommended for developers)
# DEBUG_FLAGS = -g

## If you have a GNU-compatible install program, you can use it instead of the included shell script
# INSTALL = /usr/bin/install

## Sometimes, extra install flags are needed for files or directories (e.g. preserve modification time on OS X)
# INSTFLAGS_FILE = ???
# INSTFLAGS_DIR = ???

## How to update dependencies between source code files ("make depend" requires this option to be set)
# DEPEND = gcc -MM -MG

## Set this variable if "make depend" doesn't work with standard CFLAGS (e.g. Mac OS X universal binaries)
# DEPEND_CFLAGS = -O2 -Wall

## How to index source code symbols for Emacs editor ("make tags" requires this option to be set)
# ETAGS = etags

## CPU architecture and operating system used to name binary releases
# RELEASE_ARCH = ???  # e.g. i386 or x86_64
# RELEASE_OS = ???    # e.g. linux-2.6 or osx-10.4

#
# C) Overrideable defaults (usually not required)
#

## Additional libraries needed for socket/network support (none required on most platforms)
# NETWORK_LIBS =

## Some architectures (notably Windows) require binaries to have a special extension
# EXEC_SUFFIX = .exe

## Override some standard Unix utilities (if special versions are required, defaults are shown below)
# CHMOD = chmod
# CP = cp
# ECHO = echo
# RM = rm
# WC = wc -l
# TAR = tar
