##  PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE: Generic modern Unix with Gnu C compiler
##

#
# A) Required settings
#

## C compiler: Gnu C compiler (GCC) is highly recommended
CC = gcc

## C compiler flags (optimisation, warning, additional include directories)
CFLAGS = -O2 -Wall

## Linker flags (libraries to link against, search path, static linkage)
LDFLAGS = -lm

## Parser and lexical scanner generator (recommended combination is bison + flex)
YACC = bison -d -t
LEX = flex -8

## How to combine object files into a library archive (*.a) and build a table of contents
## (ranlib is optional, simply set to "echo" or so to skip
AR = ar cq
RANLIB = ranlib

#
# B) Optional (recommended) settings
#

## Support for command-line editing in CQP (using external GNU Readline library)
READLINE_LIBS = -lreadline -lhistory
READLINE_DEFINES = 

## Support for text highlighting in CQP (ncurses library is widely available)
TERMCAP_LIBS = -lncurses
TERMCAP_DEFINES = 

## Glib-2 library with platform-independent utilities (auto-detected with pkg-config by default)
# GLIB_LIBS = 
# GLIB_DEFINES = 

## PCRE regular expression library (auto-detected with pcre-config by default)
# PCRE_LIBS = 
# PCRE_DEFINES = 

## Include debugging information in binaries (depends on C compiler, only recommended for developers)
# DEBUG_FLAGS = -g

## If you have a GNU-compatible install program, you can use it instead of the included shell script
# INSTALL = /usr/bin/install

## How to update dependencies between source code files ("make depend" requires this option to be set)
DEPEND = gcc -MM -MG

## How to index source code symbols for Emacs editor ("make tags" requires this option to be set)
ETAGS = etags

#
# C) Overrideable defaults (usually not required)
#

## Additional libraries needed for socket/network support (none required on most platforms)
# NETWORK_LIBS =

## Override some standard Unix utilities (if special versions are required, defaults are shown below)
# CHMOD = chmod
# CP = cp
# ECHO = echo
# RM = rm
# WC = wc -l
