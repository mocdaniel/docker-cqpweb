##  PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE:
##  Natively tuned 64-bit binaries for Mac OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) and newer 
##  with prerequisite libraries provided by HomeBrew package manager
##

## Inherits from basic Darwin configuration
include $(TOP)/config/platform/darwin

## Make sure that Apple's gcc is used (not e.g. a fink-installed version)
CC = /usr/bin/gcc

## Tune for CPU of the build machine, compiling only 64-bit code
CFLAGS = -Wall -O3 -arch x86_64 -march=native -mtune=native

DEPEND_CFLAGS = -Wall -O3

## Use stable paths to HomeBrew installed Glib, PCRE and Readline libraries,
## so binaries will continue to work if prerequisites are updated.
READLINE_DEFINES = -I/usr/local/opt/readline/include
READLINE_LIBS = -L/usr/local/opt/readline/lib -lreadline -lhistory

PCRE_DEFINES = -I/usr/local/opt/pcre/include
PCRE_LIBS = -L/usr/local/opt/pcre/lib -lpcre

GLIB_DEFINES = -I/usr/local/opt/glib/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/local/opt/glib/lib/glib-2.0/include -I/usr/local/opt/gettext/include
GLIB_LIBS = -L/usr/local/opt/glib/lib -L/usr/local/opt/gettext/lib -lglib-2.0 -lintl

## CPU architecture and operating system used to name binary releases
RELEASE_ARCH = x86_64
RELEASE_OS = osx-10.10

## Optionally use newer Bison from HomeBrew (MacOS ships bison 2.3, which is > 15 years old)
# YACC = /usr/local/opt/bison@2.7/bin/bison -d -t
# YACC = /usr/local/opt/bison/bin/bison -d -t
