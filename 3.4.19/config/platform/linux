##  PLATFORM CONFIGURATION FILE: Generic i386 Linux

## Inherits from generic Unix configuration
include $(TOP)/config/platform/unix

## Linux distribution should include GNU install
INSTALL = install

## CPU architecture and operating system used to name binary releases
RELEASE_ARCH = i386
RELEASE_OS = linux

## For terminal info: depending on the Linux distro, we might need -lncurses, or -ltinfo, or both.
## So let's use pkg-config to find out which (since we alredy depend on pkg-config for Glib, etc.)
