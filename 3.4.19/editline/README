**
**  THIS VERSION OF Editline (CSTR) patched by Stefan Evert
**  to work with ncurses library (instead of termcap) under Linux
**

This is a slightly modified version of the CSTR Editline Distribution,
version 1.2 (see <ReadMe.rsalz> file). The source code is released under
Rich Salz's original license (see <ReadMe.rsalz> file), so that it can
be used in non-free and commercial software. 

Some additional files (such as the Makefile) are licensed under the
standard CSTR conditions which forbid commercial use. This doesn't
apply to CQP, however, because we use Editline as an external library,
so only the free C source code is contained in the final product. The
Editline distribution is included here in the CWB source tree only for
convenience and for these additional reasons:

 - we need a slightly patched version that will work with current
   Linux distributions, and may want to make further modifications
   to the library

 - CQP uses "undocumented" custom-completion functionality - function
   prototypes are taken from <editline.h>, but the call semantics were
   gleaned from the library source code, which may change in future 
   releases

 - the original CSTR Editline interprets extended ISO-Latin-* characters 
   as meta keys ('ä' == M-d), so some characters cannot be entered and 	
   will trigger funny (Emacs-style) actions instead; in the patched version, 
   meta keys have been disabled (type ESC d instead of M-d)

The Editline distribution can be removed from the CWB source tree at
any time (change the top-level makefile so it won't try to build the
Editline library, then adjust the site configuration files to include
the Editline library from its external location)
