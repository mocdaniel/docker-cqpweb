FULL INSTALL OF CWB AND CQPWEB ON MAC OS X 10.13 High Sierra (Mac Pro Server)

 - instructions should also work for MAC OS X 10.14 Mojave
 - this assumes that everything is run from an admin account, which can write to /usr/local
 - we'll sometimes use the environment variable $ADMIN to refer to the name of this account
 
	export ADMIN=`whoami`


1) Install XCode from Mac App Store

 - don't forget to (re-)install the command-line tools

	xcode-select --install

 - and agree to the XCode license agreement so you can actually use the tools
 
	sudo xcodebuild -license


2) Install HomeBrew package manager

 - from https://brew.sh with the command

	/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

 - NB: this is a fairly large download; if installation finishes quickly and prints out a message about the XCode license, you forgot the last step in 1)


3) Obtain CWB code from SVN repository

 - it's best to check out the entire repository so we have all necessary code as well as the manuals in one place

	svn co http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cwb/code/ CWB

 - $CWB always refers to the root of the SVN source code tree in the commands below
 
	export CWB="`pwd`/CWB"


4) Install CWB version 3.5

	cd $CWB/cwb/trunk

 - HomeBrew makes it easy to install the necessary libraries (as listed in the INSTALL file)
 
	brew -v install glib pcre readline

 - now compile CWB using HomeBrew libraries and install in standard location

	make all PLATFORM=darwin-brew SITE=standard
	make install PLATFORM=darwin-brew SITE=standard
	make realclean

 - test that CWB/CQP are installed and run properly
 
	cqp -v			     # v3.4.15 or newer
	cwb-config --prefix  # should be /usr/local

 - create directories for the registry and CWB index files
 
	mkdir -p /usr/local/share/cwb/registry
	mkdir -p /usr/local/share/cwb/data


5) Install CWB/Perl modules

	cd $CWB/perl/trunk

 - CQPweb needs only the basic CWB bundle

	cd CWB
	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	sudo make install
	make realclean
	cd ..

 - but it's recommended to install everything because they might come in handy
 - repeat the procedure above for the other subdirectories, i.e.
		
	CWB-CL
	CWB-CQI
	CWB-Web


6) Learn how to install and query CWB corpora

 - work through the Corpus Encoding and CQP Query tutorials
	
	cd $CWB/doc/tutorials
	open CWB_Encoding_Tutorial.pdf CQP_Tutorial.pdf

 - you can also download the tutorials (or read them online) from http://cwb.sourceforge.net/documentation.php#tutorials
 - but these versions might be slightly outdated

 - for first corpus encoding experiments, you can index the small corpus at
  
	$CWB/doc/corpora/encoding_tutorial_data/vss.vrt

 - you might also want to install the DICKENS-1.0 corpus for the CQP tutoria and as a minimal example corpus for CQPweb
  
	$CWB/doc/corpora/dickens/release/Dickens-1.0.xml.gz

 - here we've played around in directory ~/Software/corpus_encoding (admin user)
  
	cd ~/Software/corpus_encoding

 - there's a shell script for indexing the VSS corpus and a Perl script for the DICKENS corpus
  
	cat install_vss.sh
	cat encode_dickens.perl

 - further documentation for the relevant tools is obtained with
  
	man cwb-encode
	perldoc cwb-make
	perldoc CWB::Encoder
	

7) CQPweb installation

 - getting CQPweb to run can be a bit tricky
 - in my experience it's best to follow the CQPweb admin manual TO THE LETTER

	open $CWB/gui/cqpweb/trunk/doc/CQPwebAdminManual.pdf

 - enable the Apache Web server (this should be persistent after reboot)
 
	sudo apachectl start

 - verify that Apache is actually working: the Web page should say "It works!"
  
	open http://localhost/

 - the HTML tree of the Apache Web server is found in
  
	cd /Library/WebServer/Documents

 - check out latest CQPweb version from SVN (so we can easily upgrade later)

	sudo svn co http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cwb/code/gui/cqpweb/trunk cqpweb

   CAUTION: at the time of writing, the SVN trunk is in a transitional state between
   CQPweb 3.2 and 3.3 and cannot be used; please check out the stable 3.2 branch instead:

	sudo svn co http://svn.code.sf.net/p/cwb/code/gui/cqpweb/branches/3.2-latest cqpweb


 - adjust permissions, assigning all files to our admin user account
  
	sudo chown -R $ADMIN cqpweb
	sudo chgrp -R _www cqpweb
	sudo chmod -R g+rwX,o+rX,o-w cqpweb
	sudo find cqpweb -type d -exec chmod +s {} \+

 - it might be a good idea to add the admin user to the group _www so it's easier to edit files

	sudo dscl . append /Groups/_www GroupMembership $ADMIN

 - we will use $CQPWEB to refer to the CQPweb root directory below
 
	export CQPWEB=/Library/WebServer/Documents/cqpweb


8) CQPweb prerequisites

 - Apache, PHP and Perl are already included in Mac OS X
 - we have already installed CWB and CWB/Perl

 - install R from https://cloud.r-project.org/ (Mac OS X package)

 - install MySQL Community Server from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/ (.dmg download recommended)
 - for MySQL 8.0+ it might be a good idea to use "legacy password encryption" in the installation procedure
 - remember the password for the "root" MySQL user set in the installation! (here: password)
 - NB: installation adds a preference pane from which MySQL server can be started and stopped

 - we'd like to have the mysql command-line client in the search path, of course

	ln -s /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql /usr/local/bin


9) Setting up PHP (Sec. 1.7)

 - initialize the PHP configuration from defaults and give the admin user access
  
	cd /etc
	sudo cp php.ini.default php.ini

 - here we use TextMate to edit the init file, which can be invoked with the terminal command "mate"

	mate php.ini
	
　 TextMate will automatically ask for a password when saving to overwrite the system file 	
	
 - for other editor programs, it may be necessary to assign the file to our admin account

	sudo chown $ADMIN php.ini

   (but this breaks TextMate, so don't enter this command if you're going to edit with TextMate)

 - make the following changes on appropriate lines (cf. admin manual Sec. 1.7)
 - note that some of these may be commented out and you have to remove the # at the start to activate them

	max_execution_time = 600
	memory_limit = 512M
	post_max_size = 256M
	upload_max_filesize = 256M
	mysqli.allow_local_infile = On
	mysqli.default_socket = /tmp/mysql.sock

   you may need even higher limits if you want to upload and encode large corpora via the Web interface


10) Set up directories and access permissions for CQPweb (Sec. 1.8)

 - it is easiest to collect all CQPweb data directories in /usr/local/share/cqpweb
 - note that this can also be symbolic links to an external drive if desired

	mkdir /usr/local/share/cqpweb
 
   OR
   
	ln -s /Volumes/LaCie/cqpweb /usr/local/share

 - make sure that the Web server has write access to all directories

	cd /usr/local/share/cqpweb
	for dir in data registry temp upload; do mkdir $dir; done
	chgrp www data registry temp upload
	chmod +s data registry temp upload
	chmod 775 data registry temp upload


11) Apache configuration (Sec. 1.9)

 - edit Apache2 configuration files using your favourite text editor (here: TextMate)
 - if you use another editor than TextMate, you may have to make the files readable by the $ADMIN account as above for php.ini

	mate httpd.conf

 - uncomment the following lines in the configuration file

	LoadModule ssl_module libexec/apache2/mod_ssl.so
	LoadModule cgi_module libexec/apache2/mod_cgi.so
	LoadModule php7_module libexec/apache2/libphp7.so
	
   (CGI is not required by CQPweb, but by many other Web interfaces)

 - create an additional config file for CQPweb
 
	sudo touch other/cqpweb.conf
	mate other/cqpweb.conf

 - enter the following lines in this file
 
	<Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents/cqpweb/">
		Options FollowSymlinks
		Require all granted
	</Directory>

	<Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents/cqpweb/bin/">
	  	Require all denied
	</Directory>
	<Directory "/Library/WebServer/Documents/cqpweb/lib/">
	  	Require all denied
	</Directory>

  - now we have to restart Apache on order to activate the changes, after checking that there are no syntax errors
  
	 apachectl -t
	 sudo apachectl restart


12) MySQL configuration (Sec. 1.10)

 - this is poorly explained in the CQPweb manual, which assumes that administrators are experienced in working with MySQL
 - connect to MySQL as "root", using the password defined in the installation procedure
 
	mysql -u root -p

 - now enter the following SQL commands as explained in the CQPweb manual
 - you'll want to choose a better password for the cqpweb user account below!
 
	CREATE DATABASE cqpweb DEFAULT CHARSET utf8;
	CREATE USER cqpweb IDENTIFIED BY 'CPQweb';
	GRANT ALL ON cqpweb.* TO cqpweb;
	GRANT FILE ON *.* TO cqpweb;
	SET PERSIST local_infile = 1;
	EXIT;


13) Final CQPweb setup (Sec. 1.11 + 1.12 + 2.4)

	cd $CQPWEB

 - use the autoconfig.php to set up a basic configuration file

	cd bin
	php autoconfig.php

 - when prompted, enter the following information; again, you'll want to choose a better password
 
	sysadmin username: 		cqpwebadmin
	directory for CWB data files: 	/usr/local/share/cqpweb/data
	directory for CWB registry:	/usr/local/share/cqpweb/registry
	directory for CQPweb cache: 	/usr/local/share/cqpweb/temp
	directory for uploaded files: 	/usr/local/share/cqpweb/upload
	MySQL username:			cqpweb
	MySQL password:			CPQweb [as above]
	MySQL database:			cqpweb
	MySQL hostname:			localhost

 - unfortunately, CQP and R are not on the Web server's standard search path, so we have to edit the configuration file
 
	mate ../lib/config.inc.php

 - add the following two lines anywhere within the file (between <?php and ?>)
 
	$path_to_cwb = '/usr/local/bin';
	$path_to_r = '/usr/local/bin';
	
 - now we can complete the setup of CQPweb
 
	php autosetup.php

   when prompted, enter a password for the cqpwebadmin user (e.g. "CPQweb", or rather a better one)

 - you should now be able to log into CQPweb at
 
	open http://localhost/cqpweb/


14) You can later update CQPweb through SVN

	cd $CQPWEB
	svn update

  - be sure to read the admin manual whether a database upgrade is required and follow the instructions there!
  - to be on the safe side, always run
  
	cd bin
	sudo -u _www php upgrade-database.php
