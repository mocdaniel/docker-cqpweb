	IMS Open Corpus Workbench (CWB)
	Release 3.5 (ALPHA)


The IMS Open Corpus Workbench (CWB) is a highly specialised database and query
processor for large text corpora with linguistic annotations.  The CWB uses a
proprietary read-only format to store corpora with token-level annotations
(such as POS tags, lemmata, morphological features, etc.) and shallow
structural markup (sentences and paragraphs, as well as mildly recursive
syntactic chunks and phrases).  The read-only approach allows corpus data to
be fully indexed and compressed efficiently, so that the CWB scales easily to
corpora of several hundred million words.

The main components of the CWB are a set of command-line utilities for
encoding, indexing and compressing annotated text corpora (using a simple "one
word per line" input format), tools for decoding and accessing frequency data
(cwb-decode, cwb-lexdecode, cwb-scan-corpus), and most importantly the
powerful and versatile query processor CQP.  It is strongly recommended to use
the CWB in combination with the CWB/Perl package (available separately), which
simplifies the encoding process and provides a comprehensive and well-tested
API to the functionality of the CWB.
